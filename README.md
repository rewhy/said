# SAID (State-Aware Injection Defense)
Defense Framework against Vehicular Message Injection Attacks

The system directory contains the source code of SAID implementation, the experiment directory contains used scripts for the evaluations, and the data directory contains the data collected from the real vehicles.

## System
The implementation of SAID includes three major modules, the Android app, the native library, the configurations, and the customized Android system, which are implemented in the directories app, native-lib, config, and kernel_imx_mpu6050, respectively.

## Experiment
During evaluations, we conducted three major types of expeirments, including attacks on real vehielcs and testbed, simulatied attacks, and robotic cars, and you can find the used scripts in Attack, Simulation and Robotic directories.

## Data
We also collected the 600 KM real-road data from two vehicles and three drivers.
